EagleX — Where Emotion Drives Motion

EagleX is a next-generation mobility simulator that blends physics, AI, and emotion to recreate the thrill of live racing. Built from our passion for Formula 1, it offers a driver’s-eye view of focus, stress, and performance, alongside a live, intelligent race dashboard for operators.

Problem Statement

Most simulators focus only on data. EagleX adds the missing human element, emotion and adaptability, creating a truly engaging and lifelike simulation.

What it Does

It models multiple agents such as cars, drones, or fleets racing in real time with events like crashes, pit stops, and recoveries. The built-in NeuroDrive system connects emotional states like focus and stress to vehicle performance, making every race unpredictable and alive.

Key Features

Emotion-driven racing (NeuroDrive)

Live leaderboard and event feed

Driver POV and operator dashboard

Real-time motion and event simulation

Customizable race modes and replay system

Tech Stack

React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn-ui, Framer Motion, Node.js, Express.js, WebSockets, Vercel

Challenges

Time constraints limited UI refinement, but the core simulation logic and emotional model were fully implemented.

What’s Next

Refine the UI, add multiplayer modes, and integrate real neural or sensor-based emotional input.
